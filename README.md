## CMP1043-5.1 User Stories and Personas

### Persona 1 - Jenny

![Jenny, 29, Footscray](./images/jenny.jpg)
Jenny, 29, Footscray

Jenny worked hard ever since she left university to save up enough money for a downpayment on a house. Last September she finally bought the house of her dreams in West Footscray. The property is a bit older than the other ones in the neighbourhood, but she figured that with a bit of extra work on the weekends she could fix it up in no time. However due to Jennys busy work schedule and social obligations she hasn’t gotten around to fixing up the front yard. Last year Jenny got a lot more money back from her tax returns than she expected and because she just moved into her own home, her friends and family gave her cash instead of presents for Christmas. Jenny would like to use some of that extra money that she got and pay someone to fix her front yard for her.
Jenny works very long hours in an office in the CBD of Melbourne. It’s an open plan office, so it’s difficult for her to talk on the phone during the day. She prefers to take care of things via text or email. She is somewhat patient, but does expect to get a swift answer any time she contacts customer support or a business for an inquiry.

### Persona 2 - Anahil

Anahil, 66, Richmond

This is Anahil. She worked as a Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of Melbourne.
Her children all moved out many years ago and her partner passed away recently.
Last year she retired and decided that it’s time to remodel her two-bedroom house in Richmond. She also wants to remodel the outdoor spaces of her home. She enjoys gardening and growing her own vegetables. She’s also always experimenting with creating new strains of rice that need less water than the conventional types.
She used a computer when she worked at the University, but outside of work she prefers to get her news from a print newspaper, reads physical books and goes to classical music concerts. She occasionally uses her laptop to print out the latest journal articles in the field of Molecular Biology, and to do some research. She has a cell phone but only uses it for a few minutes a day, to keep in touch with her two children via WhatsApp.

### User Stories

Jenny

- Wants to be able to get to the website and request a quote without any hassle.
- Wants to get contacted back via email or text and not phone.
- Expects to get some sort of feedback when she fills out a form online to know that it actually did go through.
- Usually accesses websites from her phone, doesn’t have patience for websites that are not mobile friendly.
- Wants to see some examples of what the business can do without having to read too much text.

Anahil

- Wants to be able to go to the website of a landscaping business that is not too overloaded with information, because a website that is heavily convoluted is difficult for her to navigate.
- Wants to be able to quickly find the phone number of the business so she can call them.
- Wants to see what type of landscapings they have done in the past. Ideally she wants to see some before and after pictures so she can assess what the skill level of the landscaper is.
- Wants to read what previous customers had to say about the business.
- Needs the website to have large enough fonts so that she can read what it says.

## CMP1043-4.1 & CMP1043-5.3 Wireframes and documentation

### Design process

We started out making lo fidelity paper prototypes like the one you can see below:

![initial version of the homepage](./images/paper.JPG)

From there we started sketching things out on figma. You can see the wireframes in the next few sections below.

Eventually we created clickable prototypes, which you can in the last part of this section.

### Wireframes with comments

Below you can see the basic wireframes with comments.
